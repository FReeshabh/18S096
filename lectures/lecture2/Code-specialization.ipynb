    "In lecture 1, we learned how the semantics of types affect performance — it was not *possible* to implement a C-speed `sum` function, for example, unless (a) the element type is attached to the array as a whole so that (b) the element data can be stored consecutively in memory and (b) the computional code can be specialized at compile-time for `+` on this element type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For code to be fast, however, it must also be possible to take advantage of this information in your own code.  This is obviously possible in statically typed languages like C, which are compiled to machine instructions ahead of time with type information declared explicitly to the compiler.  It is more subtle in a language like Julia, where the programmer does *not* usually explicitly declare type information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will talk about how Julia achieves both fast code and *type-generic code* (e.g. a `sum` function that works on any container of any type supporting `+`, even user-defined types), by aggressive automated **code specialization** by the Julia compiler."
