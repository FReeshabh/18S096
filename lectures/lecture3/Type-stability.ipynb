    "## Defeating type inference: Type instabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "To get good performance, there are some fairly simple rules that you need to follow in Julia code to avoid defeating the compiler's type inference.   See also the [performance tips section of the Julia manual](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/performance-tips/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't use (non-constant) global variables in critical code — put your critical code into a function (this is good advice anyway, from a software-engineering standpoint).  The compiler assumes that a **global variable can change type at any time**, so it is always stored in a \"box\", and \"taints\" anything that depends on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Local variables should be \"type-stable\": **don't change the type of a variable inside a function**.  Use a new variable instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions should be \"type-stable\": **a function's return type should only depend on the argument types, not on the argument values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To diagnose all of these problems, the `@code_warntype` macro that we used above is your friend.  If it labels any variables (or the function's return value) as `Any` or `Union{...}`, it means that the compiler couldn't figure out a precise type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third point, type-stability of functions, leads to lots of important but subtle choices in library design.  For example, consider the (built-in) `sqrt(x)` function, which computes $\\sqrt{x}$:"
